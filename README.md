==============================METAL GEAR QUAKE==============================
The main goal of this mod is to transform the Quake 4 into a stealth-action 
game inspired by the Metal Gear Series.  Basic mechanics and features from 
those games (specifically the first one) have been implemented to some extent.

Objective: Clear out all enemies as discrete as possible.
